#### My notes

I'd suggest you pick up a second-hand pc for $5 - $10 from your thrift store and play around with the hardware If you have no prior experience with building and/or repairing computers.

I also highly suggest you practice keeping it neat when repairing hardware, for example losing PC screws is common as they roll here and it usually isn't a big deal but losing a smartphone screw can prevent you from closing a device so I'd suggest you keep it tidy and organize at all time.&#x20;

My other advice is to get good quality tools (quality doesn't mean expensive), buy them once, and cry once.
