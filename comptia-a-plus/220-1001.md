#### My notes

I'd suggest you pick up a second-hand pc for $5 - $10 from your thrift store and play around with the hardware If you have no prior experience with building and/or repairing computers.

I also highly suggest you practice keeping it neat when repairing hardware, for example losing PC screws is common as they roll here and it usually isn't a big deal but losing a smartphone screw can prevent you from closing a device so I'd suggest you keep it tidy and organize at all time.&#x20;

My other advice is to get good quality tools (quality doesn't mean expensive), buy them once, and cry once.

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)

#### General Information

* The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the **brain of a computer**. It is responsible for executing most instructions that a computer receives, and **it performs all of the necessary calculations**.
* **Machine language**, also known as **machine code** or **assembly language**, is a low**-level programming language** that is used to **directly control the behavior of a computer's hardware**. It consists of a series of instructions written in binary code (1s and 0s) that the CPU can execute directly. It is typically used by the CPU to **execute instructions** and perform basic tasks, **such as moving data around**, **performing calculations**, and **accessing memory**.
* **AX, BX, CS,** and **DX** are all general-purpose registers that can be used to store data.
* **x86** and **x64** are two different CPU architectures that are used in personal computers. Both architectures are based on the Intel x86 architecture.
  * x86: This architecture is used in 32-bit CPUs and is designed to be backward compatible with older software. It can address up to 4GB of memory.
  * x64: This architecture is used in 64-bit CPUs and is an extension of the x86 architecture. It can address more than 4GB of memory and is designed to take advantage of the additional processing power and memory available in 64-bit systems.

#### CPU Types

*   x86: This is a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture that is used in many personal computers. It is a popular choice for desktop and laptop computers and is known for its compatibility with a wide range of software.


*   ARM: This is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture that is used in many mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. ARM processors are known for their energy efficiency and are often used in devices that need to conserve battery power.


*   MIPS: This is another RISC architecture that is used in a wide variety of devices, including routers, network switches, and embedded systems. MIPS processors are known for their simplicity and efficiency.


*   PowerPC: This is a RISC architecture that was originally developed by IBM and is used in a variety of systems, including personal computers, game consoles, and embedded devices.



    * SPARC: This is a RISC architecture that is used in many high-performance computing systems and servers. SPARC processors are known for their scalability and are used in a wide range of applications, including scientific research and data analytics.

#### Cores and Threads

Most modern CPUs have multiple **cores**, which **are separate processors that can execute instructions independently**. A CPU with multiple cores can run **multiple threads** simultaneously, which **allows it to perform multiple tasks at the same time** and can improve its overall performance also **known as HyperThreading**. **Cores and threads** are **important in determining the overall performance and capabilities of a CPU**.

#### Clock Cycle

The clock cycle refers to the duration between two oscillator pulses in the CPU. The higher the faster.

#### Cooling

You can cool the CPU in two ways with either Air Cooler or Water Cooler, also remember to apply thermal paste when installing the heatsink.

#### CPU DNA

Each CPU has its own naming scheme based on the model, generation, and features. Here is a breakdown of how to read both AMD and INTEL CPU names:

Intel Core i9 12900K

AMD Ryzen 9 5900X

| Brand | Tier     | Generation | Model | Suffix (Feature) |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Intel | Core i9  | 12         | 900   | K                |
| AMD   | Ryezen 9 | 5          | 900   | X                |

K usually refers to the ability to overclock in Intel Core i CPUs.

X usually refers to the ability for more overclocking features in AMD Ryzen CPUs.

#### Choosing the right CPU

1. Determine your workload: The first step in choosing a CPU is to determine what you will be using it for. If you plan to use your computer for general tasks such as browsing the web, using office applications, and streaming media, a mid-range CPU should be sufficient. If you plan to use your computer for more demanding tasks such as video editing, 3D rendering, or gaming, you will need a more powerful CPU.
2. Consider the number of cores and threads: CPU performance is often measured in terms of the number of cores and threads it has. A core is a unit of processing power, while a thread is a sequence of instructions that can be processed by a single core. In general, a CPU with more cores and threads will be able to handle more tasks at once, making it a better choice for multitasking or heavily-threaded workloads.
3. Look at the clock speed: The clock speed of a CPU, measured in GHz (gigahertz), determines how quickly it can execute instructions. A higher clock speed generally means that the CPU will be faster, but other factors such as the number of cores and the architecture of the CPU can also affect performance.
4. Consider compatibility: When choosing a CPU, you need to ensure that it is compatible with your motherboard and other hardware. Make sure that the socket on the motherboard is compatible with the CPU, and check that the motherboard has the necessary BIOS support for the CPU.
5. Future Proof: Consider the long-term performance needs of your workload: If you anticipate that your workload will become more demanding in the future, it may be worth investing in a more powerful CPU that can handle those demands. This can help ensure that your system remains capable of running your applications efficiently over time.
6. Consider your budget: CPU prices can vary significantly, so it's important to consider your budget when making a decision. In general, you can get good performance at a mid-range price point, but if you need the highest performance possible, you may need to spend more.

### Random Access Memory (RAM)

#### RAM Technologies

Like many other technologies, RAM evolved over the years, there are a number of different RAM technologies to keep in mind but more importantly, you need to check your motherboard and CPU capability when choosing RAM. Two things that you should check if the RAM generation and RAM speed capability with your bot CPU and Motherboard.

**SD-RAM:** 2 notches, 168 pins, Speed was equal to the motherboard I/O speed.

**DDR SDRAM** (Doube Data Rate): 1 notch, 184 pins, speed is equal to I/O speed x 2, speed is written on the box

**DDR2**: 1 notch, 240 pins, speed is written on the box, speed is equal to DDR I/O speed x 2, speed is written on the box

**DDR3:** 1 notch, 240 pins but notch is slighty in a different position than DDR2, speed is written on the box, speed is equal to DDR I/O speed x 2, speed is written on the box

**DDR4**: 1 notch, 288 pins, speed is written on the box, speed is equal to DDR I/O speed x 8, Speed is in MegaTransfer, speed is written on the box

#### RAM Capacity



### Motherboard (Mainboard)

#### Personal Suggestion

Many tend to throw out their computer parts boxes and manuals which is ok as long you take the serial number out of the box (cut it out with a cutter or knife) but the only thing that I would suggest you keep is your Motherboard's user manual as it has very valuable information regarding you motherboard for instances while most motherboards utilize RAM slot 2A and 2B for dual channel ram, I've had a motherboard that utilizes 1A and 1B and I didn't know that until I read through the user manual.
